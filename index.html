<h2> A funny story</h2>
I've been  visiting a Kangoroo site eating a banana and suddently I've seen all the kangoroos running toward me.  Instead of throwing my banana away, I've escaped with it and let them chase me.  I've seen the biggest one accelerating toward me and then I've got rid of my banana.  Instead of eating the banana he's scrached me and kicked me on the ground to show me that he was stronger and I  was being a jerk.
<i>ve been kicked by a kangoroo.</i>
